# Update Memory Bank (UMB)

Update the memory bank with current circuit analysis and FMEA development context.

**REQUIRED**: Use this command after any significant development work to maintain project context.

## Updates These Files:
- `.memory_bank/activeContext.md` - Current FMEA/QA development session
- `.memory_bank/decisionLog.md` - New analysis algorithm and architecture decisions
- `.memory_bank/progress.md` - Quality assurance milestone updates
- `.memory_bank/productContext.md` - Circuit analysis value proposition updates

## When to Use:
- After implementing FMEA analysis features
- When making risk assessment algorithm decisions
- After completing AI integration work
- Before switching development focus areas
- After resolving complex analysis methodology issues

The memory bank enables AI assistants to maintain rich context about circuit analysis development patterns and FMEA methodology decisions across sessions.
