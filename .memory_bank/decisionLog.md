## Architectural Decisions

### ADR-001: Simplified FMEA Implementation for v0.0.1
**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Status**: Implemented  

**Context**: Need for professional circuit analysis library with FMEA capabilities.

**Decision**: Start with simplified FMEA analyzer rather than complex ML-based system.

**Rationale**:
- Faster time to market with basic functionality
- Foundation for future AI enhancements
- Easier testing and validation
- Clear upgrade path to advanced features

**Implementation**:
- SimpleFMEAAnalyzer with basic risk scoring
- Mock analysis results for v0.0.1 demonstration
- CLI interface for immediate usability
- Professional API structure for future enhancement

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Quick delivery of working analysis tool
- ✅ Clear foundation for AI enhancement
- ✅ Testable and demonstrable functionality
- ⚠️ Limited analysis depth in initial version

### ADR-002: Integration with KiCAD Libraries
**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Status**: Implemented

**Context**: Circuit analysis requires access to schematic and PCB data.

**Decision**: Depend on kicad-sch-api and kicad-pcb-api for circuit file access.

**Rationale**:
- Leverage proven schematic and PCB parsing
- Avoid duplicating file format handling
- Focus on analysis algorithms rather than parsing
- Ensure consistency with circuit manipulation tools

**Implementation**:
- Dependencies in pyproject.toml on sister libraries
- Circuit parsing through established APIs
- Analysis operates on parsed circuit objects

### ADR-003: CLI-First Approach
**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Status**: Implemented

**Context**: Quality assurance workflows need automation and scripting support.

**Decision**: Provide comprehensive CLI interface alongside Python API.

**Rationale**:
- Engineering workflows often script-driven
- CI/CD integration requires command-line tools
- Immediate usability without Python programming
- Professional tool integration patterns

**Implementation**:
- `kicad-fmea` command for FMEA analysis
- `kicad-qa` command for general quality assurance
- Flexible output formats (JSON, PDF, Excel)

### ADR-004: Risk Scoring Methodology
**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Status**: Implemented

**Context**: Need quantitative risk assessment for engineering decision-making.

**Decision**: Implement severity-weighted risk scoring with 0-100 scale.

**Rationale**:
- Familiar scoring scale for engineering teams
- Enables quantitative comparison of designs
- Foundation for probabilistic enhancements
- Clear thresholds for decision-making

**Implementation**:
```python
# Risk calculation based on issue severity
severity_weights = {'High': 30, 'Medium': 15, 'Low': 5}
risk_score = min(sum(weights[issue.severity] for issue in issues), 100)
```

### ADR-005: Professional Reporting Framework
**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Status**: Planned

**Context**: Engineering teams need professional documentation for design reviews.

**Decision**: Support multiple report formats suitable for different audiences.

**Planned Implementation**:
- **PDF Reports**: Executive summaries and detailed analysis
- **Excel Reports**: Data analysis and tracking
- **JSON Reports**: Integration with other tools and databases

**Rationale**:
- Different stakeholders need different report formats
- Professional presentation increases tool adoption
- Structured data enables further analysis and automation
